title: Choosing an Application Type
---

The **Application Type** you select depends on the types of both your application and the user your application is authenticating.

  1. Is this a Web Application trying to authenticate end users?

    Select **Web App** as the application type. This translates to the “authorization code” grant type in OAuth.
  1. Is this a Native Mobile App trying to authenticate end users?

    If your application is a thick client application such as desktop apps, command line apps, or Native Mobile apps with no browser interaction, choose the **Native Mobile App** type. This translates to the "Resource Owner Password" grant type in OAuth.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This application type is intended only for highly trusted applications such as company owned and managed applications.
  1. Is this application trying to authenticate itself?

    If the application is trying to access other services or APIs on its own behalf rather than on the user’s behalf, the application must authenticate itself using the Single Sign-On service. Choose the **Service-to-Service App** type. This translates to the "Client Credentials" grant type in OAuth.
  1. Is this a Single Page Javascript application to authenticate end users?

    If your web application is a Single Page Javascript Application (In-browser apps), choose the **Single Page JavaScript App** type. This translates to the "implicit" grant type in OAuth.
