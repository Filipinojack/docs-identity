title: Single Sign-On Overview
owner: Identity Service
---

This documentation describes installing and configuring the [Single Sign-On](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-identity) service.

The Single Sign-On service is an "all-in-one" solution for securing access to applications and APIs on Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;. The Single Sign-On service provides support for native authentication, federated single sign-on and authorization. Native authentication and federated single sign-on (i.e. SAML) can be configured to verify the identities of the users of applications. Once authenticated, the Single Sign-On service uses OAuth 2.0 to secure resources or APIs. 

### Single Sign-On

Single sign-on allows users to log in through the Single Sign-On service and have access to other applications that are hosted or protected by the service. This improves security and productivity as users will not have to log in to individual applications.

Developers are responsible for selecting the authentication method for users of your application. They can select from native authentication provided by the UAA or external identity providers.

### OAuth 2.0 Concepts

- **Resource Owner**: A subject that is capable of granting access to a protected resource (i.e. a person or system).
- **Resource Server**: The server hosting protected resources (via APIs), which is capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.
- **Applications**: A client that makes protected requests on behalf of the resource owner using their authorization.
- **Authorization Server**: The Single Sign-On server, which issues access tokens to client applications after successfully authenticating the resource owner using their authorization.

### OAuth 2.0 Example Flow

<%= image_tag 'images/oauth_auth_code.png' %>

In the flow above, we have an authenticated user who is attempted to access a to-do list application which is backed by a resource server - both are secured by the UAA authorization server.

1. The first time the user accesses the application, the application requests authorization to access the user's to-do items. 
2. The application asks the user, "Do you want to allow the to-do list app to access your to-do items?" The user clicks Yes to authorize the application to access their items on their behalf.
3. After the user authorizes to-do list app, the authorization sends an authorization code.
4. The application receives the authorization code and requests an access token from the authorization server, which gives the application access to the user's to-do items.
5. The authorization server will validate the authorization code and issue an access token.
6. The to-do list application requests the resource from the resource server (API) and presents the access token.
7. If the access token is valid, the resource server returns the to-do items that the user has authorized the application receive.

Developers define the permissions associated with API endpoints for the resource server that is pushed to PCF under a given space and organization. To do this, developers create resources which correspond to API endpoints secured by the Single Sign-On service. Applications are granted access to resources which they can access on behalf of users.
