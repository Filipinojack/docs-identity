Identity Provider Initiated Testing

# 

Note: The Single Sign-On service does not support identity provider initiated flow into applications, but it does redirect the user to the UAA page to select applications assigned to the user.

# 

1. Sign into Okta.

<%= image_tag '../images/pivotal_signing.png' %>

1. Navigate to the application.

<%= image_tag '../images/pcf_app_tile.png' %>

1. You should be redirected to the page that lists applications you have access to.

<%= image_tag '../images/where_to.png' %>

Single Sign-Off Testing

1. Sign into the sample application. You should see information about the access and ID token. You should also see the “What Do You Want to Do?” section.

<%= image_tag '../images/what_do_you_want.png' %>

1. Click Log out and you will be logged out and redirected to the Okta log in page.
