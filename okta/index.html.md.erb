Okta is an enterprise identity management and single sign-on service that integrates with applications in the cloud, on-premises, or on a mobile device. This documentation describes how to configure a single sign-on partnership between Okta as the Identity Provider (IdP) and the Single Sign-On Service (SSO) for Pivotal Web Services (PWS) as the Service Provider (SP). 

SSO supports service provider-initiated authentication flow and single logout. It does not support identity provider-initiated authentication flow. All SSO communication takes place over SSL.
