Once you make a plan visible to organizations, a service instance applies the plan to the applications within a space. If you want a plan to allow Single Sign-On to applications in multiple spaces, you must create a separate service instance for the plan in each space.

## <a id='create-svc-instance'></a> Create Service Instances

1. Log in to Apps Manager at `https://console.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` as a Space Developer.

2. Navigate to the organization that the service plan is enabled for.

3. Select **Marketplace** and select the Single Sign-On service you want to create an instance of.

4. Choose your service plan and click **Select this plan**.

5. In the **Configure Instance** box, enter an **Instance Name**.

6. From the **Add to Space** dropdown menu, choose a space for the instance. This space hosts your application. The default is ‘development’.

7. From the **Bind to App** dropdown menu, choose an application to bind the service instance to. This option defaults to `[do not bind]`. If you do not bind the instance to an app, you can bind it at a later time.

8. Click **Add** to create the service instance.

## <a id='delete-svc-instance'></a> Delete Service Instances

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Deleting a Single Sign-On service instance will delete all the configurations on the service instance. This will delete all the associated service bindings. All applications bound to the service instance will need to be rebound to another service instance in Apps Manager. This cannot be undone.</p>

1. Log in to Apps Manager at `https://console.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` as a Space Developer.

2. Navigate to the organization and space that contain the service instance you want to delete.

3. Under **Services** in the space page, find your service instance and click **Delete**.

1. Click **Delete** on the pop-up to confirm that you want to delete the service instance and service bindings.
