# Manage Service Instances

<Table of Contents>

# 

Once a plan is made visible to organizations, users can a create service instance for the service plan within a space. A service instance must exist in each space containing applications the service plan will provide access. If a plan allows single sign-on to applications in multiple spaces you must create a service instance for the plan in each space.

## Create Service Instances

1. Log in to Apps Manager at https://console.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN as a Space Developer.

2. Navigate to the organization that the service plan is enabled for.

3. Navigate to the Marketplace and select the Single Sign-On service.

4. Select your service plan and click Select this plan.

5. Enter an Instance Name.

6. Choose space for the instance from the Add to Space dropdown menu. This should be the space where your application is hosted. The default is ‘development’.

7. Choose an application to bind the service instance to from the Bind to App dropdown menu. This option defaults to [do not bind]. This allows you to bind applications at a later time.

8. Click Add to create the service instance.

## Delete Service Instances

Note: Deleting a Single Sign-On service instance will delete all the configurations on the service instance. This will delete all the associated service bindings. All applications bound to the service instance will need to be rebound to another service instance in Apps Manager. This cannot be undone.

1. Log in to Apps Manager at https://console.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN as a Space Developer.

2. Navigate to the organization and space where the service instance you want to delete is in.

3. Click Delete on the service instance and a confirmation modal should appear to ensure that this is the intended action

4. Click Delete to delete the service instance and service bindings.
