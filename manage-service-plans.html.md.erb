# Manage Service Plans

<Table of Contents>

## 

The Single Sign-On service is a multi-tenant service and a service plan corresponds to a tenant. As an enterprise adopting Single Sign-On for Pivotal Cloud Foundry, you might want to segregate your tenants into separate plans. For example, the following tenants might require separate plans:

* Business units and geographical locations

* Employees, consumers, and partners

* Development, staging, and production instances

You can create new Single Sign-On Service Plans at any time from the SSO dashboard with administrator credentials.

## Create or Edit Service Plans

Note: You can create and configure service plans at any time. However, you must create at least one plan in order to register and use the service with applications on your [Pivotal Cloud FoundryÂ®](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) installation.

1. Log in to https://p-identity.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN using your administrator credentials where you will find the SSO dashboard.

Note: You can find the UAA administrator credentials in your Pivotal Elastic Runtime tile in Ops Manager under the Credentials tab.

1. Click New Plan on the SSO dashboard to create a new Single Sign-On service plan.

2. Enter a Plan Name.

3. Enter a Description.

4. Enter a Auth Domain. This will be the URL where users will authenticate to access the applications of the service plan.

5. Enter an Instance Name. The instance name appears on the login page and in other user-facing content, such as email communications.

6. Add Plan Administrators. These can view this plan and manage the identity providers for this plan.

7. Under Org Visibility, select which organizations in your Pivotal Cloud Foundry deployment should have access to your Single Sign-On service plan. If you do not select any organizations, the plan will not be available for use and it will not be displayed in the Services Marketplace in Apps Manager.

8. Click Save Plan. Your new plan will appear in the Apps Manager Marketplace to users in the organizations you have selected. You can also access the Services Marketplace by entering cf marketplace in a terminal window.

## Delete Service Plans

Note: Deleting a Single Sign-On service plan will delete all the configurations and identity providers on the plan. Users and configurations in the internal user store will be deleted. This will also delete all the associated service instances and service bindings. All applications bound to the service instances will need to be rebound to another service instance in Apps Manager. This cannot be undone.

## 

1. Log in to https://p-identity.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN using your administrator credentials where you will find the SSO dashboard.

2. Click Edit Plan in the dropdown by clicking the plan name.

3. Click Delete at the bottom of the page and a confirmation modal should appear to ensure that this is the intended action.

4. Click Delete Plan to delete plans, identity providers, service instances and service bindings.
