This topic describes the OAuth 2.0 password grant type supported by Pivotal Single Sign-On (SSO). The password grant type is used when an application is highly trusted and is created by the service itself. This can be used for native mobile or desktop applications.

### OAuth 2.0 Actors

- **Resource Owner**: A person or system capable of granting access to a protected resource.
- **Application**: A client that makes protected requests using the authorization of the resource owner.
- **Authorization Server**: The Single Sign-On server that issues access tokens to client applications after successfully authenticating the resource owner.
- **Resource Server**: The server that hosts protected resources and accepts and responds to protected resource requests using access tokens. Applications access the server through APIs.

### Native Mobile App Flow

1. **Authenticate w/ Username and Password**: The user authenticates using their credentials to the application.
2. **Send Username/Password**: The application sends the username and password to the authorization server for validation.
3. **Issue Access Token**: The authorization server validates the user's credentials and issues an access token.
4. **Request Resource w/ Access Token**: The application tries to access the resource from the resource server by presenting the access token.
5. **Return Resource**: If the access token is valid, the resource server returns the resources that the user authorized the application to receive.

The resource server runs in PCF under a given space and organization. Developers set the permissions for the resource server API endpoints. To do this, they create resources that correspond to API endpoints secured by the Single Sign-On service. Applications can then access these resources on behalf of users.
